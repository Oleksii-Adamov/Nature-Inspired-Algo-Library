# Nature-Inspired-Algo-Library with visualization: Ready
## Description:
### Static library that contains universal algoritms: Genetic algorithm(Tournament selection, Roulette Wheel Selection), Ant colony optimization algorithm(ant system) for solving TSP( Travelling salesman problem). You can visialize proccess of rununing this algorithms. To do this, I used OPENGL, GLFW, GLEW, GLM. ~~Rendering and calculations are running simultaneously using std::tread.~~
## All documentation in Documentation\html\index.html (generated by Doxygen from code comments)
## Notes:
### Commented threads because somehow they slow my program.
### Used unit testing for Genetic algo.
### Results word file contains results of running algorithms for euclidiean TSP with 52 vertecies and
