# Nature-Inspired-Algo-Library with visualization: In progress
## Description:
### Static library that contains universal templated algoritms: Genetic algorithm(Tournament selection, Roulette Wheel Selection). You can visialize proccess of rununing this algorithms. To do this, I used OPENGL, GLFW, GLEW, GLM. Rendering and calculations are running simultaneously using std::tread.
